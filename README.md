## General info
This project helps people by enabling them to practice and perform Yoga at the comfort of their homes.This project uses the latest Google Creative Lab collaboration - the TensorFlow.js version of PoseNet, a machine learning model which allows for real-time human pose estimation in the browser.
The site is setup in a game like environment where you can compete with other users to rank on top of the leaderboard.
All you have to do is try and perform the same Asana on the screen in the correct posture for the given time,and there you go!
The more asanas you perform in the correct manner the higher you rank on the leaderboard.
So what are you waiting for? See you on the top !
